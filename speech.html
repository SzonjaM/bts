    I’m Kim Namjoon, RM of BTS.
    I’m a hip-hop idol and an artist from a small town in Korea.
    Like most people, I made many mistakes in my life.
    I have many faults and I have many fears, but I am going to embrace myself as hard as I can, and I’m starting to love myself, little by little.
    What is your name? Speak Yourself!</cite>
